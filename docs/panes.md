# Panes

Wazari has a funciton to split views. We call one of the view as pane.  By default. `Alt-Ctrl-%` to horizontal spliting and, `Alt-Ctrl-"` to split vertically.  You can move panes with `Alt-o` or `Alt-shift-o`(reverse cycle).  You can also change the size of pange with `Alt-shift-{` or `Alt-Shift-}`.
